## Short Description
This is a software which can efficiently manage your library. From performing tasks like viewing all the books to issuing books to students, it can do everything. It has two portals on the homepage, one for Employee and the other for Students. The Employee has all the rights to -
* Add a new book/s
* Delete any book
* View all the books in the library
* Search for any particular subject to list all the books of that subject present in the library
* Issue book to student
Whereas in the Student Portal, they get rights to -
* View all the books
* Search for a specific one

You can either register as an Employee if you haven't done that yet or else just Login like any other portal, same applies to the Student portal. Once you register yourself you will be added to the serveside database from where your details will be fetched at the time of login.
